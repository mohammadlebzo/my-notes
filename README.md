## Introduction

Hello, my name is **Mohammad Nart Lebzo**, my major is **software engineering**, I'm *passionate* about making and playing video games, I have great experience in many programming languages, but my favorite so far are **Javascript** and **C#**.

I am currently looking to expand my knowledge in **Python** programming to better my self.

## Good Developer Mindset

In order to finish projects with the *best possible quality* the developer **must** be under a **certain mindset** to ensure the best possible outcome, and I'll be mentioning now some of the key points of this mindset in no particular order:

- **The developer must understand the purpose of the project / software before starting to develop it**.
- **The developer should try as much as possible to keep the code clean and clear**.
- **The developer should by all means avoid feature creeping, because it adds unnecessary complexity to the projet**.
- **The developer should first understand the problem before starting to code a solution**.
- **The developer should try to start small and build upon the work, because you can't make the "perfect" build from the first time, trial and error is importent**.

And there are many others but lets leave it here for now.
